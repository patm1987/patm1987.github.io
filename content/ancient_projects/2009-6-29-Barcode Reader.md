<!-- title: Barcode Reader -->

# Barcode Reader

This is a barcode reader written mostly in C# (although some portions have been delegated to c++). Given a picture with a custom barcode format it is able to locate the barcode, orient it, and parse the data it stores. The details of the implementation are described in the paper listed below.
