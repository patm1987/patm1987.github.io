<!-- title: Pinballman: Beyond the Arcade -->
Pinballman was my first true game.  It took me about three months to make the original game, and I have since debugged it and fixed it.  Sometime around 1999 – 2000 I essentially lost my sourcecode.  I made this game originally with Klik & Play from Clickteam .  I eventually updated it to The Games Factory, another product by the same company.

Excerpt from my old page:

Graphics aren’t good, and it was programmed in Klik & Play. It is kind of addictive, I hope you like it. If I ever make a 3d game sucessfully, I will attempt to make Pinballman 3d. Pinballman 2 was being developed but was thrown off track and lost.
