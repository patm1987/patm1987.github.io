<p>
I'm a gamer, game developer, Android expert, roboticist, toy maker, musician living in Colorado. Currently I work at Google as a Developer Relations Engineer for Android games, although you may know me from my time as a Developer Advocate for Firebase game developers. I've also built robots and games with Sphero ranging from the original Sphero (back when we were called Orbotix) and ending with Sphero's RVR. I also worked at Venan Entertainment with in house games as well as contract work for EA and Actvision on iOS, Android, and macOS.
