<h1>New Year, New Site</h1>

<p>
    I previously maintained a blogger site (the old <a href="https://patrick.games/">patrick.games</a>) and a Wordpress site that eventually succummed to my lack of maintenance and started serving malware. In an effort to simplify my online presence and maintenance thereof, I've pulled all my data into a static site (thanks to the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">Makesite project</a>) going forward.
</p>
<p>
    I may write about the process going forward, but so far this feels like an improvement and the technology stack (python and some html) I absolutely love.
