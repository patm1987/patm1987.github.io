<!-- title: PFrogger-->

Another one of my old games, and the first one that I can say I actually programmed using Jamagic (which uses a scripting language nearly identical to Javascript).

An excerpt from my old website (I am maintaining the spelling errors):
>This is a clone of the classic frogger game, yet very diffrent. Get to the red square up top, then the Exit sign to complete a level. Current status:Final. Last levels are done in a world editor I never could complete. This game was put on halt because my laptop was serviced for 4 months by Best >Buy. By then I got a new game Idea. Look out for Sockhead, I hope to complete my first 3d game, and then maby attempt Space Things 3d again.

>This game is designed for a port to the pocket pc, so press right to select anything from the menu.
>
>Updated with 12 levels.

>Additionally, I have a PocketPC binary but cannot attest to it’s ability to run on modern PDA’s (I don’t own a Windows Mobile device).  Written for Windows CE 3.0 on a 206 MHz XScale PocketPC.
