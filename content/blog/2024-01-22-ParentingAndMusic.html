    About a year ago, I realized that we had a problem. My daughter refused to try to read. She'd get incredibly frustrated and rage quit halfway through a page. It wasn't just reading either, anything that took effort wasn't worth doing.
</p>
<p>
    After a number of chats, I pieced together a cause I wasn't expecting: she's surrounded by superhumans! In the time she might spend on a single tricky word, the adults that surround her can read a whole page. Adults can do math in their heads, are magically good at video games, and can ride bikes without training wheels. Imagine if every single thing you tried to do, the people around you could do instantly and orders of magnitude better. Every time someone helped her solve a problem, as innoculous as it may seem, her self esteem took a hit.
</p>
<p>
    This stinks. How do you level the playing field between a bunch of adults and a five year old?
</p>
<p>
    Well, with music of course!
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that her favorite superhero is "Ghost Spider" from <i>Spidey and his Amazing Friends</i>. Ghost Spider was a drummer, and my daughter had been gifted a kid sized drum set a few years earlier. So she was overjoyed to learn that I'm signing her up for drum lessons!

    The next problem is that although we didn't play instruments currently, we had in the past? How do we level set the adults? If we all start out playing poorly, but then the adults are playing sonatas a month in, we'd end up sabotaging the entire process!
</p>
<p>
    The solution is really weird instruments of course! My wife had always wanted to learn a banjolele and that was suitably different than the piano. As for me: have you ever heard of a hurdy gurdy?
</p>

<p>
    So, how's it going?
</p>
<p>
    My daugher calls my hurdy gurdy a swarm of bees. Where I've plateaued, she's clearly getting better at drums! This doesn't solve the problem though: she needs to see that it's possible to succeed.
</p>
<p>
    But I eventually picked up a pennywhistle which led to the irish flute. She's watched me go from horrid squeaking sounds to playing some of her favorite songs.
</p>
<p>
    It also turns out that I'm really bad a drums. A year in, and she's already blowing me away.
</p>
<p>
    This means that when she can't finish a sentence in a book or game, we start talking about music. About what my hurdy gurdy sounds like, about how my pennywhistle doesn't squeak anymore, and the fact that I can't bounce drumsticks for a drumroll. We haven't magically solved self esteem, but now we have tools to talk about and frame the problem. And when all else fails, we can play a bit of music together.
</p>
<p>
    Should you do the same?
</p>
<p>
    What I love about this approach is that we don't need participation trophies. We're not artificially praising something she does to try to boost self esteem. We're not losing on purpose or trying to coordinate with other adults to do the same. My daughter can feel real progress and is witnessing our real progress (and real failure).
</p>
<p>
    And as a cherry on top, I'm re-igniting my old love of music that was slowly killed by years of piano practice. At some point I discovered the mountain dulcimer, and between that and the flute and pennywhistle I couldn't be happier.
