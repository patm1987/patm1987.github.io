    About a year ago, I ran into a problem that plenty of other parents have likely noticed: my 5 year old was terrified and ashamed of messing up. No matter how we framed it, she was afraid to take risks and this was getting in the way. She didn't want to practice reading, she didn't want to do math, if she didn't get it the first try then she didn't want to try at all.
</p>
<p>
    I spent a lot of time talking about this with her. Was she being bullied? Were we accidentally shaming her?
</p>
<p>
    That's when I realized it: she's surrounded by superhumans! At least to a kid. She spends a lot of time around adults. Adults who can just look at a word and know how to read it. Adults who could do math in their heads. Adults who were just good at video games. Imagine if every single thing you tried to do, the people around you could do instantly and orders of magnitude better.
</p>
<p>
    So I have a problem: my kid is afraid of trying things and pushing herself because she'll mess up the first time.
</p>
<p>
    I also have a cause: in the time it takes her to sound out a word, we can just belt out a whole paragraph.
</p>
<p>
    Now for a solution. This is when I had another realization: one of her favorite superheroes was "Ghost Spider" from  <i>Spidey and his Amazing Friends</i>. Ghost Spider was a drummer, and she had been gifted a kid sized drum set a few years earlier.

    So my daughter wanted to play drums, and my wife wanted a banjolele. An idea started to form.
</p>
<p>
    Music is hard. I spent years learning piano as a kid (and subsequently forgetting it) and failed hard to learn violin and guitar. As long as I stayed away from piano-shaped instruments, we could all learn together. And most importantly, my daughter would see us fail. A lot. Repeatedly. And badly. But over time she'd see us get better and, eventually, play well.
</p>
<p>
    Oh, and if my wife was playing a banjolele and my daughter drums. What was I going to learn? The hurdy gurdy of course!
</p>

<p>
    So, how's it going?
</p>
<p>
    She calls my hurdy gurdy a swarm of bees. But I eventually picked up a pennywhistle which led to the irish flute.
</p>
<p>
    My daugher still gets frustrated when she can't read a sentence or is having a hard time on her math homework. But when that happens though, I can say "how did my pennywhistle sound last year?" or "what does my hurdy gurdy sound like?" After making a sound like a swarm of bees or screeching, I can say "and how does my whistle sound now?"
</p>
<p>
    She's also been taking drum lessons. It turns out that I'm really bad a drums and rhythm, and she can see how much better she is than I am when we play.
</p>
<p>
    And me? Let's say that it's really hard to play a mountain dulcimer poorly! I'm starting flute lessons of my own as well.
