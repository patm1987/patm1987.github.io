# PJDesktop

PJDesktop is a desktop replacement I made using Java for my final AP Computer Science project during High School.  I found it does work on Windows XP/Vista, Mac OSX, and Linux with most Window Managers.  Some window managers and OSX tend to cut of some of it by forcing the draw of a bar or dock above it

It is rather extensible, but it doesn’t dynamically scan for files so most things have to be compiled in.  It supports nifty features like alpha blending .  This is available under the GPL License.

This is meant to essentially be a desktop layer, replacing your icons, start bar, etc. with this Java window.  If you’re using Linux it works best if you set it to be the root window.
